                    <p>I've been studying JavaScript since January 2023, and it is the language I am most like. I have completed a few online courses and consider myself somewhat proficient in it.</p>

                    <img src="../pictures/html.png" alt="HTML logo" >
                    <p>My first contact with the programming world was with HTML, in mid-September 2020, and I consider it a very easy language to master.</p>

                <img src="../pictures/css.png" alt="CSS logo">
                <p>Just like HTML, I have been using CSS since 2020, and I can use both simple and complex tools without much difficulty. Sometimes, I even create projects just to test my knowledge.</p>

            <div id="c">
                <img src="../pictures/c++.png" alt="C++ logo" >
                <p>I attend a high school that offers technical teaching in programming, where I take algorithm classes in C++. I really enjoy solving problems using this language.</p>

                <img src="../pictures/python.png" alt="Python logo">
                <p>Perhaps Python is the language I am least familiar with, but as my studies in JavaScript and C++ become more advanced, I see Python as a simple and feasible path to explore in the future.</p>
