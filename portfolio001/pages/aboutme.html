            <p>  I'm a high school student, I'm fourteen years old, and I love to program.
                 My biggest dream is to work outside of Brazil. For that, I study English and French every day.
                 I hope that one day I can live in a good place and work with what I've always loved.
            <br>
                I've been studying programming since 2020, when I was 11/12 years old, due to the influence of my uncles.
                Since then, I haven't stopped because I discovered a passion for solving problems using mathematics.
                Today, I see great opportunities in this field, especially outside of Brazil.
